# uwpce-vagrant
A vagrant build for a python development environment

![Image](screenshot.png?raw=true)

One of the challenges we face as developers on a team or as students in a classroom setting is getting everyone quickly up and running with a full fledged, feature rich, functional and consistent, homogenous Python development environment.  Vagrant allows us to quickly build a virtual machine with everything we'll need.

The Vagrantfile in this repo builds an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine.  It pre-installs the latest versions of programming editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and requires about 30 minutes to build on a fast network.  It should work on Linux, OS X or Windows so that by the end of the installation you will have an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine running on top of your host operating system, be it OS X, Windows, or another instance of Linux.

Prerequisites
-------------

1.  Install Virtual Box for your host operating system

    https://www.virtualbox.org

2.  Install Vagrant for your host operating system

    https://www.vagrantup.com

Installation Steps
------------------

1.  Attach your computer to a fast network, attach your laptop to a power supply to prevent it from going to sleep, provide for up to four hours for the 'vagrant up' command to do its work.  When wired onto a fast home network 'vagrant up' might take only twenty minutes.

2.  First option: clone this repo, change into the directory and start the vagrant build:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/rriehle/uwpce-vagrant.git
    $ cd uwpce-vagrant
    $ vagrant up
    ```

    Or, second option, if you do not have git installed on your local/host machine, download these files as a zip archive using the "Clone or download" button above, unzip the files, change into the directory with the Vagrant file, and start the vagrant build.

    ```
    $ cd uwpce-vagrant
    $ vagrant up
    ```

3.  Restart your new virtual computer and login:

    ```
    $ vagrant reload
    ```

    Username: vagrant<br>
    Password: vagrant

Usability Notes
---------------

Disable screen saver and power management within the virtual machine.  These issues are best left to the host computer.

Windows Issues
--------------

[Run Hyper-V and VirtualBox on the same machine](https://derekgusoff.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/run-hyper-v-and-virtualbox-on-the-same-machine/)  Tl;dr: You might need to disable Hyper-V when using VirtualBox.

[Can't download boxes on Windows 10.](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/6754)  Tl;dr: You might need to download Microsoft's .NET Redistributable Framework.
